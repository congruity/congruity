I am quite willing to give you a copy of congruity licensed under practically
any license (BSD, Public Domain, ...) However, please note that since
libconcord is licensed as GPLv3+, you would not be able to use any relicensed
versions of congruity with libconcord. However, my hope is that the
application code (e.g. GUI creation etc.) may be useful for arbitrary
other purposes.

I should probably find a better source...
