- congruity-10 is released
- Implement IR learning feature, with support for learning from the original
  remote using the Harmony, or reading the signal from a "Pronto Hex" file.
  (Merge of /branches/irlean)
  Parts based on code by Andreas Schulz <Andreas.R.Schulz@gmx.de>
- Various internal code changes to support IR learning and general cleanup.
- Implement --no-web command-line option, which prevents posting any data
  to the Harmony website. This can be useful when testing congruity.
- Change default install prefix to /usr/local; this makes typical end-user
  manual installs slightly simpler. Also, automatically patch install location
  into the app during installation.
- If libconcord import fails, display the entire backtrace information, to
  enable easier debugging of the issue.
- Enhance README

* 2008-09-07 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-9 is released
- Use a different remote.png, with a known free license.

* 2008-07-03 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-8 is released
- Centralize cancel/exit handling,
  and clean up any libconcord resources when exiting the application.
- Add thread-safe cancelling to ConnectPanel.
- Work around a typo in libconcord 0.20's Python bindings.
- Provide a GUI message if libconcord can't be loaded, in case congruity
  wasn't run from a terminal.

* 2008-07-02 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- Increase connect timeout after a reset operation, just to make sure
  we don't miss the remote coming back.
- Fix Makefile to create all directories files are written to, and add
  a few more variables that can be tweaked e.g. by packaging scripts.
* On behalf of Andreas Schulz <Andreas.R.Schulz@gmx.de>
- Use a simpler and potentially more reliable fix for GTK buttons not
  accepting clicks if the mouse was inside the widget when enabled.

* 2008-07-01 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- Command-line parsing errors are displayed by the GUI, instead of being
  echo'd to stdout. This makes errors visible when congruity is launched
  without a terminal

* 2008-06-25..2008-07-01 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
* Inspired by Andreas Schulz <Andreas.R.Schulz@gmx.de>
- Significant internal structural changes to the implementation, which
  simplify things a lot, and make program flow far more obvious, localized,
  and correctly polymorphic.
- Add a separate "connect" page, so that the other pages don't have to
  re-implement this common function.

* 2008-06-17 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
* On behalf of Andreas Schulz <Andreas.R.Schulz@gmx.de>
- Fix issue where next button wouldn't respond to clicks if the pointer was
  already within the button when it was re-enabled.

* 2008-04-14 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-7 is released
- Switched license to GPLv3+ to be compatible with libconcord by default.
  Contact me if you want the code under a different license, but please
  note that you won't be able to use relicensed code with libconcord.
- Added a Makefile for easy installation.
  Thanks to Phil Dibowitz for the contribution.
- Added a manual page.
- Added a few useful URLs to README.txt.
- Fixed reliance on syntax specific to Python 2.5.

* 2008-04-13 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-6 is released
- Search for images in /usr/share/congruity, the source directory, then
  CWD. This should allow easy system-wide installation of congruity.
- libconcord.py is no longer distributed with congruity; it is now part
  of libconcord itself (see libconcord/bindings/python/).
- Apparently forgot to release LICENSE.txt before.

* 2008-04-07 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-5 is released
- This release solely operates using libconcord; "screen-scraping" the output
  from the concordance application is no longer supported.
- Implement firmware upgrade.
- Minor tweaks for operation on MS-Windows.
- congruity now sets the time on the remote after any reboot.

* 2008-03-29 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-4 is released
- Renamed package from harmonygui to congruity, in line with the
  coming rename of the harmonycontrol project to concordance/libconcord.
- Changes to match latest CVS libconcord API changes

* 2008-02-24 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- harmonygui-3 is released
- Added README.txt.
- Added LICENSING.txt, to account for images too.
- Remove GUI for initial web connection in update mode; the libharmony
  branch code doesn't print this status information, so now we act like
  it was never there.
- Code re-org, to allow for multiple back-ends.
- Added a back-end that calls libharmony.so directly using ctypes.

* 2008-02-10 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- harmonygui-2 is released
- Updated ezhexparser to recognize firmware update files.
- Updated GUI to handle firmware updates, by informing user its
  not yet supported.
- Separated ezhexparser and tuiparser operation mode enumerations.
- Enhanced ptyrun error handling, so it's more obvious what happened
  when the harmony application can't be found in the $PATH.
- Updated harmonyfake to use ^H characters to re-write output, not
  \r. This matches the real harmony app.
- Minor typo cleanups in messages.
- Added licensing information.
- Added this Changelog

* 2008-02-05 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org> 
- harmonygui-1 is released
- Initial release.
