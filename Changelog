* 2013-04-16 Scott Talbert <swt@techie.net>
- congruity-16 is released
- Port congruity to the new libconcord API which enables support for a
  significant number of new remotes (200/300, 890/895, 900/1000/1100, One).
- Add mhgui which provides an alternative front end to myharmony.com website,
  enabling support for Harmony 200/300.
- Fixed an issue with certain remotes (e.g., 525) where the remote is not
  detected after a reset.

* 2010-??-?? Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- Fixed messages to refer to a "finish" button instead of a "next" button.
  Related: Refer to "clicking" this button instead of "pressing" it.
- Detect at least some bad IR learning results.

* 2010-08-01 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-15 is released
- Call new APIs in libconcord-0.22, for Harmony 700 support.
- Tweak WrappedStaticText.UpdateText again, so it shows all text and doesn't
  wrap it strangely, at least with Lucids's wxpython 2.8.10.1-0ubuntu1.

* 2009-12-16 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-14 is released
- replace remote.png with a GPL-licensed version provided by 
  Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre <mathieu.tl@gmail.com>
- Tweak WrappedStaticText.UpdateText so it shows all text and doesn't wrap it
  strangely, at least with Jaunty's wxpython 2.8.9.1-0ubuntu6.

* 2009-08-04 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-13 is released
- Update MIME types in .desktop file
  Patch by Adam Williamson <awilliam@redhat.com>

  Apparently, these new MIME types match what the Logitech server sends
  when you perform a download:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=506536#c12

  However, Fedora still packages definitions of these MIME types as part of
  libconcord. Packagers for other distributions should double-check the
  Fedora packaging of libconcord; see file libconcord-0.21-mime-type-def.patch
  which adds file concordance-0.21/libconcord/libconcord.xml to the
  libconcord sources.

* 2009-06-17 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-12 is released
- Add congruity.desktop to release script

* 2009-06-17 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-11 is released
- Fix Pronto hex import
  Patch by Andreas Schulz <Andreas.R.Schulz@gmx.de>
- Throw runtime error dialog if wxPython version is not at least 2.8
- Add .desktop file
  Patch by Adam Williamson <awilliam@redhat.com>

* 2009-03-09 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-10 is released
- Implement IR learning feature, with support for learning from the original
  remote using the Harmony, or reading the signal from a "Pronto Hex" file.
  (Merge of /branches/irlean)
  Parts based on code by Andreas Schulz <Andreas.R.Schulz@gmx.de>
- Various internal code changes to support IR learning and general cleanup.
- Implement --no-web command-line option, which prevents posting any data
  to the Harmony website. This can be useful when testing congruity.
- Change default install prefix to /usr/local; this makes typical end-user
  manual installs slightly simpler. Also, automatically patch install location
  into the app during installation.
- If libconcord import fails, display the entire backtrace information, to
  enable easier debugging of the issue.
- Enhance README

* 2008-09-07 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-9 is released
- Use a different remote.png, with a known free license.

* 2008-07-03 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-8 is released
- Centralize cancel/exit handling,
  and clean up any libconcord resources when exiting the application.
- Add thread-safe cancelling to ConnectPanel.
- Work around a typo in libconcord 0.20's Python bindings.
- Provide a GUI message if libconcord can't be loaded, in case congruity
  wasn't run from a terminal.

* 2008-07-02 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- Increase connect timeout after a reset operation, just to make sure
  we don't miss the remote coming back.
- Fix Makefile to create all directories files are written to, and add
  a few more variables that can be tweaked e.g. by packaging scripts.
* On behalf of Andreas Schulz <Andreas.R.Schulz@gmx.de>
- Use a simpler and potentially more reliable fix for GTK buttons not
  accepting clicks if the mouse was inside the widget when enabled.

* 2008-07-01 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- Command-line parsing errors are displayed by the GUI, instead of being
  echo'd to stdout. This makes errors visible when congruity is launched
  without a terminal

* 2008-06-25..2008-07-01 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
* Inspired by Andreas Schulz <Andreas.R.Schulz@gmx.de>
- Significant internal structural changes to the implementation, which
  simplify things a lot, and make program flow far more obvious, localized,
  and correctly polymorphic.
- Add a separate "connect" page, so that the other pages don't have to
  re-implement this common function.

* 2008-06-17 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
* On behalf of Andreas Schulz <Andreas.R.Schulz@gmx.de>
- Fix issue where next button wouldn't respond to clicks if the pointer was
  already within the button when it was re-enabled.

* 2008-04-14 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-7 is released
- Switched license to GPLv3+ to be compatible with libconcord by default.
  Contact me if you want the code under a different license, but please
  note that you won't be able to use relicensed code with libconcord.
- Added a Makefile for easy installation.
  Thanks to Phil Dibowitz for the contribution.
- Added a manual page.
- Added a few useful URLs to README.txt.
- Fixed reliance on syntax specific to Python 2.5.

* 2008-04-13 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-6 is released
- Search for images in /usr/share/congruity, the source directory, then
  CWD. This should allow easy system-wide installation of congruity.
- libconcord.py is no longer distributed with congruity; it is now part
  of libconcord itself (see libconcord/bindings/python/).
- Apparently forgot to release LICENSE.txt before.

* 2008-04-07 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-5 is released
- This release solely operates using libconcord; "screen-scraping" the output
  from the concordance application is no longer supported.
- Implement firmware upgrade.
- Minor tweaks for operation on MS-Windows.
- congruity now sets the time on the remote after any reboot.

* 2008-03-29 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- congruity-4 is released
- Renamed package from harmonygui to congruity, in line with the
  coming rename of the harmonycontrol project to concordance/libconcord.
- Changes to match latest CVS libconcord API changes

* 2008-02-24 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- harmonygui-3 is released
- Added README.txt.
- Added LICENSING.txt, to account for images too.
- Remove GUI for initial web connection in update mode; the libharmony
  branch code doesn't print this status information, so now we act like
  it was never there.
- Code re-org, to allow for multiple back-ends.
- Added a back-end that calls libharmony.so directly using ctypes.

* 2008-02-10 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org>
- harmonygui-2 is released
- Updated ezhexparser to recognize firmware update files.
- Updated GUI to handle firmware updates, by informing user its
  not yet supported.
- Separated ezhexparser and tuiparser operation mode enumerations.
- Enhanced ptyrun error handling, so it's more obvious what happened
  when the harmony application can't be found in the $PATH.
- Updated harmonyfake to use ^H characters to re-write output, not
  \r. This matches the real harmony app.
- Minor typo cleanups in messages.
- Added licensing information.
- Added this Changelog

* 2008-02-05 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org> 
- harmonygui-1 is released
- Initial release.
