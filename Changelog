* 2008-04-14 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org> - congruity-7
- Switched license to GPLv3+ to be compatible with libconcord by default.
  Contact me if you want the code under a different license, but please
  note that you won't be able to use relicensed code with libconcord.
- Added a Makefile for easy installation.
  Thanks to Phil Dibowitz for the contribution.
- Added a manual page.
- Added a few useful URLs to README.txt.
- Fixed reliance on syntax specific to Python 2.5.

* 2008-04-13 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org> - congruity-6
- Search for images in /usr/share/congruity, the source directory, then
  CWD. This should allow easy system-wide installation of congruity.
- libconcord.py is no longer distributed with congruity; it is now part
  of libconcord itself (see libconcord/bindings/python/).
- Apparently forgot to release LICENSE.txt before.

* 2008-04-07 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org> - congruity-5
- This release solely operates using libconcord; "screen-scraping" the output
  from the concordance application is no longer supported.
- Implement firmware upgrade.
- Minor tweaks for operation on MS-Windows.
- congruity now sets the time on the remote after any reboot.

* 2008-03-29 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org> - congruity-4
- Renamed package from harmonygui to congruity, in line with the
  coming rename of the harmonycontrol project to concordance/libconcord.
- Changes to match latest CVS libconcord API changes

* 2008-02-24 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org> - harmonygui-3
- Added README.txt.
- Added LICENSING.txt, to account for images too.
- Remove GUI for initial web connection in update mode; the libharmony
  branch code doesn't print this status information, so now we act like
  it was never there.
- Code re-org, to allow for multiple back-ends.
- Added a back-end that calls libharmony.so directly using ctypes.

* 2008-02-10 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org> - harmonygui-2
- Updated ezhexparser to recognize firmware update files.
- Updated GUI to handle firmware updates, by informing user its
  not yet supported.
- Separated ezhexparser and tuiparser operation mode enumerations.
- Enhanced ptyrun error handling, so it's more obvious what happened
  when the harmony application can't be found in the $PATH.
- Updated harmonyfake to use ^H characters to re-write output, not
  \r. This matches the real harmony app.
- Minor typo cleanups in messages.
- Added licensing information.
- Added this Changelog

* 2008-02-05 Stephen Warren <s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org> - harmonygui-1 
- Initial release.
